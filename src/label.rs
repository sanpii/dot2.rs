// There is a tension in the design of the labelling API.
//
// For example, I considered making a `Labeller<T>` trait that
// provides labels for `T`, and then making the graph type `G`
// implement `Labeller<Node>` and `Labeller<Edge>`. However, this is
// not possible without functional dependencies. (One could work
// around that, but I did not explore that avenue heavily.)
//
// Another approach that I actually used for a while was to make a
// `Label<Context>` trait that is implemented by the client-specific
// Node and Edge types (as well as an implementation on Graph itself
// for the overall name for the graph). The main disadvantage of this
// second approach (compared to having the `G` type parameter
// implement a Labelling service) that I have encountered is that it
// makes it impossible to use types outside of the current crate
// directly as Nodes/Edges; you need to wrap them in newtype'd
// structs. See e.g., the `No` and `Ed` structs in the examples. (In
// practice clients using a graph in some other crate would need to
// provide some sort of adapter shim over the graph anyway to
// interface with this library).
//
// Another approach would be to make a single `Labeller<N,E>` trait
// that provides three methods (graph_label, node_label, edge_label),
// and then make `G` implement `Labeller<N,E>`. At first this did not
// appeal to me, since I had thought I would need separate methods on
// each data variant for dot-internal identifiers versus user-visible
// labels. However, the identifier/label distinction only arises for
// nodes; graphs themselves only have identifiers, and edges only have
// labels.
//
// So in the end I decided to use the third approach described above.

/// Each instance of a type that implements `Label<C>` maps to a
/// unique identifier with respect to `C`, which is used to identify
/// it in the generated .dot file. They can also provide more
/// elaborate (and non-unique) label text that is used in the graphviz
/// rendered output.

/// identifiers for the nodes and (optionally) rendered labels for the nodes and
/// edges, as well as an identifier for the graph itself.
